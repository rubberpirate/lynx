# Lynx - .NET Reactor Reverse Engineering Challenge

## üéØ Overview

`lynx.exe` is a Windows GUI application protected with .NET Reactor obfuscation. The challenge involves bypassing the protection to extract the hidden password validation logic.

**Target Details:**
- Platform: Windows x64
- Language: .NET Framework
- Protection: .NET Reactor
- Size: 187KB
- Interface: Simple password input form

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Tools

### 1. **dnSpy** - .NET Decompiler & Debugger
- **Purpose:** Static analysis and decompilation of .NET assemblies
- **Download:** [github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)
- **Usage:** Initial analysis and final decompilation of dumped assembly

### 2. **Detect It Easy (DIE)** - Packer/Protector Detection
- **Purpose:** Identify protection schemes and packers
- **Download:** [github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy)
- **Usage:** Detect .NET Reactor protection

### 3. **MegaDumper** - .NET Memory Dumper
- **Purpose:** Basic .NET assembly dumping from memory
- **Download:** [github.com/CodeCracker-Tools/MegaDumper](https://github.com/CodeCracker-Tools/MegaDumper)
- **Note:** May not work on heavily protected executables

### 4. **ExtremeDumper** - Advanced .NET Memory Dumper
- **Purpose:** Advanced memory dumping for heavily protected .NET apps
- **Download:** [github.com/wwh1004/ExtremeDumper](https://github.com/wwh1004/ExtremeDumper)
- **Important:** Use the 32-bit (x86) version for 32-bit targets!

## üîç Methodology

### Step 1: Static Analysis
```bash
# Open lynx.exe in dnSpy
# Expected result: No visible managed code (protected)
```

### Step 2: Protection Detection
```bash
# Run Detect It Easy on lynx.exe
# Result: .NET Reactor protection identified
```

### Step 3: Attempt Basic Memory Dump
```bash
# Run lynx.exe
# Launch MegaDumper
# Attach to lynx.exe process
# Expected result: May fail due to advanced protection
```

### Step 4: Advanced Memory Dump
```bash
# Run lynx.exe
# Launch ExtremeDumper (32-bit version)
# Attach to lynx.exe process
# Dump all modules
# Result: CrackBee.exe and supporting DLLs extracted
```

### Step 5: Final Analysis
```bash
# Open CrackBee.exe in dnSpy
# Navigate to Form1 ‚Üí checkBtn_Click method
# Extract password validation logic
```

## üèÅ Solution

The password can be found by analyzing the dumped `CrackBee.exe` assembly in dnSpy. Look for the button click event handler that validates user input.
